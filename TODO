* Solver
** Struct
   Contains cosmos, power and bispectrum
** Create
** Step
** Dump

* Cosmos
** Struct
   Containts current cosmology type and scale factor
** TODO Create [0/2]
   Takes starting scale and number of fluids
   - [ ] Initialise different cosmologies
   - [ ] Multiple fluids
** TODO SetTime
   Reset the scale factor
** TODO Omega [0/1]
   Gives omega for a component
   - [ ] It should be possible to change the cosmology here
   - [ ] Implement multiple fluids
   - May be neccessary to add k dependance at one point

* Power
** Struct
** TODO Create [0/1]
   Makes the vectors to hold k, P(k)
   - [ ] Read in P(k) from somewhere
** TODO Derivative [0/1]
   Calculates the power derivative for a solver
   Takes in the entire solver, as it will need omega and bispectrum for
   full calculation
   - [ ] Implement
** TODO Dump [0/1]
   Outputs the current state
   - [ ] Implement

* Bispectrum
